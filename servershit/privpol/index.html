<a>This will prob be out of date at some times with exactly what is logged, however i keep the logs to a minimum necessary to function, and they are not shared except for extreme cases (e.g. a hacking or a ddos attack will have your info shared with authorities)</a>
<br></br>
<a>Currently i only temporarily log urls visited to console, this is likely to increase in the future tho</a>
